# Performance and Footprint

Last synchronized: 2026-07-12.

## Principle

Minimize runtime work, memory, allocations, cache misses, and stored data while preserving correctness, determinism, safety, and understandable invariants. Fewer source lines are desirable only when competing implementations are otherwise equal; source-code golfing is not an optimization.

## Optimization order

1. Avoid unnecessary work through event scheduling, locality, bounded searches, and suitable algorithms.
2. Avoid unnecessary state through sparse records, consolidation, interning, and derived values.
3. Reduce allocations and retained capacity; reuse buffers and keep hot data contiguous.
4. Improve cache locality through hot/cold separation and batch processing.
5. Use the smallest proven representation for IDs, counters, flags, weights, and coordinates.
6. Tune individual operations only after profiling identifies a meaningful hot path.

## Representation rules

- Document the valid range and overflow behavior before narrowing a type.
- Measure `size_of`, alignment, container capacity, and allocator overhead together.
- Prefer compact integer handles over pointers and object graphs for persistent simulation data.
- Quantize continuous values only with accuracy and determinism tests.
- Keep universal hot records fixed and compact; move optional variable state into sparse pools.
- Add size assertions for foundational records and benchmark representative distributions before committing budgets.

## Current measurements

No canonical release-mode benchmark report exists yet. The current terrain layout intentionally uses `u16` elevation, `u8` moisture, and a byte-represented `GroundType`, but complete record and collection costs must be measured rather than inferred from field widths.

The viewer computes one `CameraView` transform per frame rather than recomputing fit scale for every framebuffer pixel. Hover feature lookup uses binary search over sorted sparse records; rendering still scans the full sparse feature list and culls off-screen records, which remains an open optimization before worlds or feature counts grow substantially.

Selection generation is capped at 1,048,576 cells per command. Dense patches remain loaded and partially overlapping patches may duplicate terrain until chunk-keyed storage replaces them.

## Required measurement conditions

- Use release builds and a recorded compiler version.
- Use fixed seeds and identical workloads for comparisons.
- Report elapsed time, throughput, resident memory, logical payload bytes, retained capacity, and relevant type sizes.
- Include before/after results and the command used.
- Reject optimizations that alter deterministic output unless the change is intentional and documented.

## Open budgets

- Maximum hot agent-core size.
- Terrain bytes per loaded cell and per chunk.
- Sparse feature bytes per record.
- Event scheduler bytes per scheduled event.
- Allocations and generation time per world chunk.
- Release binary size and startup-time targets.
